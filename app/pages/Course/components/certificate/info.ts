## What's an EXLskills Course Certificate?

An EXLskills Course Certificate is a verification that employers around the world use to validate that you are employment-ready in the field of this course.

The certification process consists of a secure ID verification, a 45 to 90-minute proctored skills exam online, and a remote 30-minute interview call with an EXLskills Verified instructor who is a professional expert in their field.

Unlike other online certifications, EXLskills is a high-value certification that is meant to significantly accelerate your job search and, upon your approval, your perspective employers may request a detailed copy of your interview results for US$50.

In the event that your employer is unfamiliar with the details of your certification, they may contact support@exlskills.com free of charge for a summary of the certification. If they would like details of your assessment, they may be furnished upon your approval and a charge of US$50.

## Will I be able to get a refund?

Yes! We are committed to the value of our certifications, and thus we offer risk-free refunds prior to taking the examination and also within 7-days of successfully receiving your certificate. In the event that you take the examination and fail to pass, we do not offer refunds in order to avoid abuse of our system.

## What if I don't pass the certification process?

In the event that you don't meet the requirements on the examination, you will receive a detailed summary of areas to work on from your EXLskills instructor. In order to try again, you will need to purchase a certificate here and try the examination again. We require a 7-day 'cool-off' period between attempts to avoid abuse.

## Do I have to complete the course to get the certificate?

No! EXLskills Verified Certificates are issued separately from the course, so as long as you pass the examination and interview for the certificate, you will receive the certification.

We do however recommend that most users take the course, or at least the course exams, in order to prepare for the certificate interview and exam as they will be closely related.

## Can my employer purchase this certification on my behalf?

Yes. Please have your employer contact support@exlskills.com with your request, and the EXLskills support team will arrange the purchase and specific terms.

## How do I get the certificate?

In order to get an EXLskills verified certificate, you'll first need to purchase it here, then complete the ID verification, proctored exam, and interview. Once you purchase the certificate, your EXLskills Success Manager will contact you to verify your identity and schedule your exam and interview remotely. After you complete the certification process, you will electronically receive your certificate and verification ID. You may also request an internationally-mailed hard-copy for US$30.
